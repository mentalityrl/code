##### --- Basic Operators and Inputs --- #####
x = 2
name = 'Tim'
# Inside the parathensis of 'print' are allowed *arguments*
print(name)
    # This will print Tim

# Get user_input 
 print('Hello, What is your name?')
name = input()
print('Hello ', name, ' how are you?')
    #This will print: Hello user_input, How are you?

# Operators
# +, -, /, *

num1 = 40
num2 = 3

# Examples of operators being used with variables
print(num1 + num2)
print(num1 - num2)
print(num1 / num2)
print(num1 * num2)

# Exponents in Python 
** 

# Interger division
64 // 10 = 6
    # This states how many times 10 can go into 64

# However
64 / 10 = 6.4

# Modulous operator % which gives us the remainder in a equation
5 % 3 = 2

# --Example-- #
num1 = 45
num2 = 5
num3 = num1**num2 
print(num3)

# --Example-- #
print('Pick a number: ')
num1 = input()
print('Pick another number:  ')
num2 = input()

# Converting the variables that store the user input into intergers
total = int(num1) + int(num2)

# If you want to convert a number into a string
str(3) = '3'
