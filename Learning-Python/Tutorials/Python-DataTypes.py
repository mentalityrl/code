##### --- DATA TYPES --- #####

# Data Types: 4 Main data types (int, string, )


# First data type is int (interger), it can be any whole number and negative numbers
int 1, 4, 76, -5

# Second daya type is strings (anything embedded in quotations (Including intergers))
str 'Bryan', "Hello", '1', '34444'
    #--- Double quoatations or single doesn't matter

# boolean data types are capital (T)rue and (F)alse, these words cannot be used for variable names
bool True, False

# Decimals data types are referred as float
float 0.32, 1.2334

str 'Hello'
int 123
float 3.23
bool True
string '2'
string "3"

# --- Variables --- # 

name = 'Bryan'
# To access the information inside variable 'name'
print(name)
name = 'Bryan2'
print(name)
    # This will print Bryan and then Bryan2 on the next line 

# you can create variables of different data types
age = 13
print(age)
    # will print a int of 13

# ---- Notes for Variables ---#
# - Variable names have a few restrictions, such as:
    # 1name - cannot start with a number
    # cannot use '-' such as age-height 
    # cannot use '*' in the variable
# - Variables can however have:
    # name1 - numbers at the end of a variable
    # name_height - underscores in the variable

# Side note, are NAME = 2 and name = 2 and Name = 2, the same?
    # - No they are not
